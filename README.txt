This is a project by Alma Gonzalez and Maia Ross for Windows Systems Programming in Fall, 2017

This project is designed to be sort of like Microsoft Publisher and Scene Builder. Each of the four templates allows the user to make different types of GUIs or images, and once they are happy with the setup, they can save it as a screenshot.
